        <h2>What are Web Application?</h2>
        <!--using paragraph tag-->
        <p>Web applications are interactive programs that run through a web browser. Unlike regular websites that just show information, web apps let users input, process, and store data in real time. Examples include Gmail, Facebook, Amazon, and online banking platforms.</p>

        <h2> How Web Apps Connect to Databases</h2>
        <p>Most web apps rely on databases to store and retrieve user data. For example, when you log in to a website, your username and password are checked against data stored in a database. Here’s a simplified step-by-step of how this works:</p>
        <!--list bulletpoints-->
        <ul>
            <li>The user enters data or clicks a button on the web app.</li>
            <li>The browser sends the request to a web server.</li>
            <li>The web server communicates with a back-end database.</li>
            <li>The database processes the request, such as checking login details or fetching records.</li>
            <li>The result (success or error) is returned to the server.</li>
            <li>The web server then sends a response back to the user's browser.</li>
            <li>The user sees the result such as a successful login or an error message.</li>
          </ul>

    <h2>Web App Use in Business: Customers, Employees, Developers, and Database Administrators</h2>
    
    <p>Web applications serve different users in a business setting. While customers and employees use the front-end, developers and administrators work behind the scenes to make everything run smoothly. Each group interacts with the web app in a different way:</p>
  
    <h3>1. Front-End Users</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customers:</strong> Use the public-facing front-end to browse products, place orders, book services, or check their accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Employees/Admins:</strong> Use a private internal front-end (often called a dashboard) to manage the system, such as entering customer data, updating inventory, or viewing reports. They interact with the database through forms and tools but don’t write code.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>2. Back-End Roles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Build the back-end logic that powers the web app. They write code to process requests, handle form submissions, and connect the front-end to the database.</li>
      <li><strong>Database Administrators:</strong> Manage the structure and performance of the database itself. They ensure that data is stored securely and efficiently, and that the system can scale as needed.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>In summary, a business web app brings together multiple roles: customers interact with the storefront, employees manage operations, and developers ensure everything runs securely and efficiently in the background.</p>
